## ⭐ Purpose
This Portfolio Website was created to showcase some of the projects I have created in a modern and simple way.

## 🥅 Goals

### GSAP
Other than showcasing my projects, I wanted to learn GSAP, a JavaScript animation library that is used for creating smooth animations for websites.
Furthermore, I wanted to test my react knowledge to see if I can blend animations smoothly through page transitions and to create animations that can give good user feedback.

### Best Practices
CSS
* Using CSS variables for universal spacing, color, fontsize and more.
* Focus on responsiveness.

## 🚩 Issues
During the development of my project there were small issues I have ran into.
### 🔁 Iteration
The first problem I ran into while making this project is the number of iterations I have went through. This finished project is version 4 of my portfolio.
Through trial and error, each iteration has helped improve the finished website.

### 📖 Knowledge
The Second problem was knowledge check. Creating a website that uses an animation framework has put my CSS knowledge to the test. 

## 📜 Takeaways
***
Here are some of the key takeaways I gained after I finished developing this project.
* [Websites are already responsive without CSS]
  Add CSS only to improve the responsiveness and do not abuse the use of media queries.
* [CSS Variables]
  Create a set of universal CSS variables for spacing, colors, fontsize and more to improve the consistency of the website.
